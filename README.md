<h1 align="center">Vue Counter</h1>

A simple counter application built with Vue. _(It doesn't do anything impressive. It just counts.)_

The purpose of this app is to learn the basics of Vue, the Composition API and the Options API.

To edit the counter, clone the repository and install dependencies with

```shell
   npm install
```

Then, start the development server with:

```shell
   npm run dev
```
