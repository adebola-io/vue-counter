<h1 align="center">Vue Counter</h1>

A simple counter application built with Vue. It doesn't do anything impressive. It just counts.

This app was built so I could learn:

1. The basics of Vue (Which I learnt before, and then promptly forgot.)
2. The differences between the Composition API and the Options API.
3. Props and Emissions in Vue Components.
4. Reactive Variables and Objects in Vue with `ref()` and `reactive()`.
5. Using Typescript in Vue Components.
6. The `nextTick()` function in Vue.
7. Vue directives like `v-for`, `v-on` and the shortcuts like `:key` and `@click`.
8. How to create an infinite sequence with Generators. (The generator has to be assigned. It won't work if its not assigned.)

To edit the counter, clone the repository and install dependencies with

```shell
   npm install
```

Then, start the development server with:

```shell
   npm run dev
```

Or you could use pnpm or yarn.
